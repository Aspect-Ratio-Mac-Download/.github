## ❓ What is Aspect Ratio?

Aspect Ratio is a lightweight utility for macOS that allows users to identify and work with exact screen ratios across MacBook, iMac, and external displays. Whether you're designing, editing video, or just optimizing workspace layout, it ensures you know your display’s pixel-perfect dimensions and ratio in real time.

The app provides a clear breakdown of your current resolution and automatically calculates the width-to-height proportion. It's especially useful for content creators who need to match output to target devices, from 16:9 YouTube videos to 4:3 presentations or ultra-wide monitors.

Aspect Ratio supports all common Apple screen formats — from MacBook Air to 5K iMacs — and works natively on Intel and Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) machines.
